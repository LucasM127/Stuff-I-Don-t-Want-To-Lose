LineGenerator Idea.
Given a distribution of points, with two points chosen as a start and end point respectively.
Incrementally joins each point to the line use edge swapping algorithm to create a line that visits all the points without self-intersecting.
Chooses nearest point by perpendicular distance to line or if out of range of the line, using distance between points of the point and nearest endpoint.
Shortest distance is used to choose which line segment to 'snap' to include the point.
